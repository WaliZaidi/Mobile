Miscommunication and maangement within their own staff caused us soo much stress on both the night before the event (which was on the day of our Baraat), during the event, and after the shaadi event. We also had a watch stolen from the penthouse suite we'd booked for the bride + groom after the event in their hotel...\r\n\r\nWe had the food tasting for the marriage 4 days before the event. Main course was lovely, and they accommodated our feedback. HOWEVER. We for some reason weren't allowed to taste the Mocktails and Mojitos we were paying 90k Rs for, until the start of the event. The drinks were, quite literally, undrinkable. The Mint Margerita was disgusting, and made everyone who tried it cough after 1 sip. The Coconut one was literally coconut powder into milk+water. The fruit passion one was admitted to me Nestle juice and chopped fruit. All in the most basic glasses. They kept asking us how to make it. The drinks were uttery unservable, and they refused to refund us.\r\n\r\nThere were a plethora of issues, both small and big. Even if we overlook them (although you shouldn't for a 5* hotel), there are problems which I wouldn't overlook in a 3* place for a 3* price, let alone this...\r\n\r\nAbsoloutely terrible.\r\n\r\nThere's definitely good parts to it, so if you see a good 5* review, those people just got lucky and didn't get the bad parts which ruin all the good stuff like the location, hall itself and main course food. The unprofessional management, thievery, refusal to properly communicate over email, refusal to acknowledge issues, and deal with money issues caused by their own mis-communication between their staff puts a very sour taste in their customer's mouths...",

Had to wait in line for some 30 minutes before our turn to ride in the lift came. If it was a line to pay the bills or buy grocery, one would expect it but after a wedding, with the elderly, in heels and kaam wala jora, not so much. Provide benches if it's to continue like this\r\n\r\n6. Parking for the banquets needs to be segregated from the casual mall and hotel parking. Feels uncomfortable to be suited-booted like that and roaming around in the basement in search for your car. Unwelcome stares from the casual guests can be avoided. Better things expected form the investors.\r\n\r\n7. The interior and ambiance is perhaps the only enjoyable aspect of it all.",

Bbq wasn’t that good.\r\n\r\nDessert: Gajar ka halwa and Kulfi Falooda ( 9/10)\r\n\r\nNote: All items were refilled\r\n\r\nThey have different types of halls to cover small and large events.

Otherwise, Rs 15 to 18 lakhs. More if you are also crazy.\r\nIf , God forbid, you decide to abandon Hindu culture and do a Islami wedding at home, you can gift this money ( in $ in Roshni accnt) to the newly weds and it will fetch them Rs 19000 per month in fixed deposit.

However, the ice cream served was not up to my expectations.\r\n\r\nThe staff at the hall were friendly and accommodating, and the overall atmosphere was pleasant. The event went smoothly and everything was well-organized. However, the ice cream was not of good quality and did not meet my expectations.\r\n\r\nDespite this issue, I would still recommend Lord's Marriage Hall for events. The venue and service were both good, and the issue with the ice cream was relatively minor.

I thought at first, it's a good place but had two bad experiences in a row.  Also, asked DJ to play some songs and he refused that he didn't have nor the hall allows him to use internet. Like why do we pay to DJ then? Only good thing was parking but that's useless if we are to receive that poor quality of management and food there.",

We were taken to a food that was ill prepared and somewhat in a haste that was equally displeasing to the taste and combination of dishes. Had a sweaty iftar and swore never to be there again for the remainder of my life. Mosquitos and spiders got the better of us and we were all left to pay for the drinks and water that was not part of the menu. 1300 rupees for food we did not like and then further 100 bucks for the water and refreshments!!!",

That all dishes are complete (they skipped chocolate mousse in our menu and later on said \"no we served it\").\r\n2. Extra people (they observe the situation and then send some people to eat the food especially if it is a combined event). It happened with us, the people are easily recognizable and they are rude and ill mannered, there is a separate entrance on the side of the hall, these people enter from there, Just watch out for them.\r\n3. Leftover food (when the event is over, they will pack the food for themselves and say thay their staff has eaten it, whereas earlier they will communicate that the remaining food will be for the host to take home) regardless of whatever, it should be the choice of the host for what to do with the food (maybe the host would need it for dinners etc to be held later on), it's pretty evident that they probably use the food in the next events or something.\r\n4. They ask for money for their staff at the end of the event, in an extremely unprofessional manner. Are they not being paid enough?. Its wrong because event hosts are already drained of cash due to their over charging on each and every item, why should the host be blackmailed to pay extra for the staff. Its the management's responsibility.\r\n5. They charge atleast 50,000/- more than the market rate for decor and their staff miscommunicates that outside decor is not allowed. Plus they are extremely rude and arrogant.\r\n\r\nIts better to choose any of the marquees that are around that area. The staff of the weddings is highly unprofessional and they exploit you. My duty was to convey my experience, the rest is upto you. Please atleast keep an eye on the above mentioned points when you plan your event with them.",

The place is genuinely a marvel, located on the foothills of Margalla Hills; along a belt-line of all other Marquees. One distinctive feature that really caught my eye was the impeccable service over there. How there were waiters available to assist you in every way has never been witnessed by me in such marquees before. The quality of food there was competing right with the very best. I was especially awed by the neatness they went for with everything; symmetrically aligned tables with special care put for all the individual guests. Plus the interior and the decor, although not overly grand, but all in all was pretty good, and suited with the occassions. One thing to keep in mind is that it's a place that can host a moderate amount of guests. Thus for celebrations involving large parties, one should probably look elsewhere.\r\nWell for me, the experience has always been, and still is one of the greatest wedding experiences ever!",

The only thing requiring attention is the lack of space for prayers, which was just a corner mat where only a handful of people could pray at one time.

If that is improved it is a 5 star facility in Peshawar!",

Another thing I'd like to add is that when you choose a wedding hall built consecutively next to other halls, your event doesn't gets the highlight it deserves and gets overshadowed by the similar happenings in the surroundings. Also, in a setting like this the guests arrive and depart at the same time which causes traffic delays.",

Food is average. Parking is fine. Another thing I'd like to add is that when you choose a wedding hall built consecutively next to other halls, your event doesn't gets the highlight it deserves and gets overshadowed by the similar happenings in the surroundings. Also, in a setting like this the guests arrive and depart at the same time which causes traffic delays.",

We asked the waiter to serve the drink to our guests which came to the wedding from other city, and the waiter said ok and didnt serve the drinks which he had in his tray. After 10 minutes, we asked the same waiter to serve the drinks to the guests sitting on our table and he said another guy was brining it. Even after asking 3rd time our guest didnt get any drink.\r\nNot recommended at all. If you want to be humilated only then book this place. No ethics, no manners, poor service. Only suggestion to the owner is Better to hire educated waiters or atleast keep them away from guests.\r\n👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼",

At 7pm when my parents entered the hall the floor was dirty, the chairs stained, the main bride and groom sofa with missing buttons and just overall disgusting looking. There were only 30 minutes till the guests were supposed to arrive. My mother had to ask them to mop the floors and father was able to get some of the chairs swapped. The main bride and groom sofa remained. The marquee was shining with dust, the 10 minute mopping did almost nothing. Even the sign outside the marquee still had last night’s Hosts names on it still. These shameless people take 100% charges 2 days before the event so you can basically do nothing. I would never ever recommend this marquee. I have never in my life written a review yet alone a bad one. But these people need to be exposed. People please save yourself from embarrassment and your hard earned money and book a different marquee for your events.",

The spacious hall easily accommodated all our guests, and the catering service was top-notch with a delectable menu that received rave reviews from everyone. The well-maintained garden added a touch of natural beauty to the event, and the ample parking space made it convenient for our guests. I can't recommend Zakia's Marriage Hall enough for any couple looking to host their dream wedding. It was the perfect venue for our special day, and we couldn't be happier with the experience!",

Good thing is that they also have wheel chair accessible parking which usually marquees Don't have. Yes its expensive but its worth it. Food was also very delicious. Management is also very cooperative. Parking space is open and wide so no issues for car parking. I recently attended marriage of my cousin Hamza Satti on this weekend there and it was great experience for me. Its far from Rawalpindi so people from Rawalpindi may find it far to come there but it's a good place for marriages. Lot of space for males and females. There was a water spring in the hall but it was not working. Over all it was a good experience.",

All dishes were outclass especially Mutton Kuna and Gajar Halwa. I would strongly advise to try their Mutton Kuna, which is indeed their specialty and would definitely be cooked in a very unique and different way by their Chief Chef. During whole dinner one of their focal person was continously supervising provision of food in each buffet. At the time of departure, additional meal for 12 persons was given in the boxes along with a bouquet of flowers, which indeed further up raised the professional approach, soft image and goodwill of the Marquee.\r\nOn behalf of my personal experience, I would strongly advise and recommend the Mass to book this Marquee for memorable occurrence of their life time event in a very unique and prestigious way.",

BBQ was slightly spicier than average servings.\r\nThere is sewerage nearby making the outside environment very unpleasent.\r\nPlates were made of clay, therefore there had been repairs on a few, I had to shuffle nearly 4 plates to get one which was clean.",

Before moving to Australia I booked the hall under the consultation of Sir Ahsraf and he was so nice that he guided us in detail and made all the arrangements perfectly.

The interior was decorated nicely but they seemed to be saving the electric bill by not turning all the air conditioners on. The food was a solid 7/10 with the live BBQ always stealing the show.

            "text": "One word “PATHETIC”\r\n\r\nSo we booked my Waleema event in Blessings Marquee on 13th Feb 2022, paid Rs. 50,000 in advance. The menu, stage décor was decided at that point of time and cooling/AC charges were not determined since we booked event in Winters and but was communicated that we’ll charge as per usage but we’ll charge minimum we can. This all was dealt with Mr. Mazhar (Manager Blessings Marquee). The days after I along with my Sister and Brother in Law visited marquee for food taste. The food was just OK and we communicated the issues as well with Mr. Mazhar and he said these issues will be address.\r\n\r\nSo we visited again on 06th May 2022 to finalize the stage décor/sitting arrangement, menu and issues with food again. At that point we met another guy Mr. Zaheer (GM Blessings Marquee) along with Mr. Mazhar and we communicated that there is a problem just before 02 days of our event that “Cambridge Exams are rescheduled” since my Waleema was Lunch event so they were like “hmain dar hay k hm marquee ki arrangements kr rhay hngae and ap k guests ana start ho jain gay”.\r\n\r\nFirstly, Cambridge communicated the reschedulement of their exams much before our event and they did not bother to communicate with us since our event is potentially at risk to get disturb “Professionalism tou seekhna hay nae hmne event pakar k Zaleel hi krna hay”, but “btaya kb 02 din phlay event sae wo b hm gae tou pata chala”. Alternatively, they gave us 2 options, to change our event to a smaller Marquee adjacent to big marquee which we already rejected at the time we booked our event since it was very small to cater our guest. The other option was presented before us was the Pacific Marquee (since Blessings, The Royal & Pacific marquee belongs to a same owner) we checked it was bit smaller than Blessings Marquee we booked but agreed to it since we don’t have any other option left.\r\n\r\nTo compensate us The GM said we’ll setup the best stage décor for you (bs bari bari bharkain mar sktay thay maar dein”, they gave us the option and we selected the option we presented and communicated via whatsapp to Manager while sitting there, keeping the sitting arrangement, pathway arrangement same. Similarly, we ask them to set blinds as well, we checked the blinds we visited the marquee but they were dirty, Manager ensures we’ll set the nice and clean blinds.\r\n\r\nHere comes the event day i.e 09th May 2022, my Brother in law visited marquee around 11:30AM, what he saw was simply drastic, the dirtiest blinds were placed, upon checking the various blinds we removed them since none of them were presentable, the stage décor we selected was not setup, pathway arrangement was changed. The GM and Manager was out from the picture since it was there event they should present there, rather a lady was there who does not know the ABC of the event. We keep call both of them none of them were picking the call, the Manager picked the call around 12:15PM and reached around 12:35PM, the manager simply said you were not finalized the décor (simply jhoot 06th May ko udhr hi beth k Whatsapp kr dya the proper message and verbally bta b dya tha, I have screen shots as well)\r\n\r\nThe max. change they have made in 25 min. they made but stage décor, sitting arrangement and blinds status same none of them were arranged that was committed. Now we shall move the worst part the Cooling System was not working, upon the commitment made that they’ll charge as per usage, the Cooling system trip number of times while all our guests arrived and we felt shear embarrassment and their worker keep said to our guest “inhn nay jitney paisay dyay hain AC ussi hisab sae chl rha”. The food was substandard, so overall the event was “PATHETIC”\r\n\r\nSo to conclude, The Venue, Décor, Sitting Arrangement, & Food was substandard, Professionalism name ki koi cheez nae and worst them all was bad/nonprofessional behavior by them (GM,Manager and their staff.)\r\n\r\nPS: An advice to all the reader, 50,000-100,000 tk budget upr  krlaina pr in ko event dai k apnay apko, Family k samny Zaleel mt krwana.",

Items went missing and without refill and this exact same thing happened three days in a row. I don't know if it was an error on the management side or the wedding party but it was horrible... Most of the guests went hungry home as it was quite embarrassing to go from table to table looking for food.",
